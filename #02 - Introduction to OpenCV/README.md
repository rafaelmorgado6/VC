# Lab 2 - Introduction to OpenCV

## Outline
* Image operations
* Reading and displaying images
* Direct pixel manipulation
* Example of a mathematical operation: image subtraction
* Interaction: selecting pixels and drawing on an image
* Conversion between color spaces


## 2.1 - Direct pixel manipulation
Read again the lena.jpg image (`aula_02_ex_01.py`) and create a copy of the image (function `copy`).
Access the pixels values of the copied image, set to 0 every pixel of the copy image whose intensity value is less than 128 in the original image, you can access a given pixel as an array image[x,y]. 
Display the original image and the modified image.
Modify the code to allow reading the name of the gray-level image from the command line. Do not forget to import the system library (`import sys`) to allow the access to the command line arguments (`sys.argv[1]`). Run the code with images with different format (see directory images and use for example the orchid.bmp). Analyze the image parametres displayed by the program (note that in some case, the shape function may return a third parameter). 

## 2.2 - Simple mathematical operation: image subtraction
Based on the previous example, create a new program that reads and displays the two image deti.bmp and deti.jpg. 
To identify possible differences between the two images, carry out a subtraction operation. Be careful since the cv subtract operation is saturated and is different from the numpy â€“ operations that is a modulo operations.
Analyze the resulting image. 

## Optional
Open an image of your choice in an image editor and save it on file using the jpeg format with different compression ratios. 
Compare the results of the image subtraction operation for different compression ratios.

## 2.3 - Interaction: selecting a pixel and drawing a circle
Modify the previous example to open and display just one image. Add a callback function to detect a right mouse click on the window and draw filled circle should be drawn, with center on the selected image pixel (function `cv2.circle`).
To register the new callback function use:
``` html
    def mouse_handler(event, x, y, flags, params):
        if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
            print("left click")
```

Do not forget to associate the callback to each window using the following code:
``` html
    cv2.setMouseCallback("Window", mouse_handler)
```
## 2.4 - Conversion between color spaces
Load a color image and use the function cvtColor to convert it to a gray-level image (`COLOR_RGB2GRAY`). 

## Optional
Consult the documentation for the function `cvtColor` and modify the example to visualize the image in different color spaces (for instance: `COLOR_RGB2HLS`, `COLOR_RGB2XYZ`, `COLOR_RGB2HSV`)
